# 5x8 pixel LED screen with Arduino

### hardware: 
The LEDs are soldered together such that all of the positives in the column row are connected and all of the negatives in each row are connected. 
Each the 5 wires column wires and 8 row wires are all connected to the arduino

### code:
Each character that the screen displays is a 2d array of 1s and 0s with each element of the array corresponding to a pixel on the screen.
I used the VS Code Arduino extension instead of the Arduino IDE to program the arduino.
